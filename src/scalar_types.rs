/*
A scalar type represents a single value. For example, 10,3.14,'c'. Rust has four primary scalar types.

1. Integer
2. Floating-point
3. Booleans
4. Characters

# INTEGERS
An Integer data type is used to represent whole numbers.Integers can be further classified as Signed and Unsigned. Signed integers can store both negative and positive values. Unsigned integers can only store positive values.
A detailed description if integer types is given below âˆ’
|-------------------------------|
| Size	  | Signed |  Unsigned  |
| 8 bit	  |  i8	   |   u8       |
| 16 bit  | i16    |  u16       |
| 32 bit  | i32	   |  u32       |
| 64 bit  | i64	   |  u64       |
| 128 bit | i128   |  u128      |
| Arch	  | isize  |  usize     |
|-------------------------------|

The size of an integer can be arch. This means the size of the data type will be derived from the architecture of the machine. An integer the size of which is arch will be 32 bits on an x86 machine and 64 bits on an x64 machine.
An arch integer is primarily used when indexing some sort of collection.

// An integer overflow occurs when the value assigned to an integer variable exceeds the Rust defined range for the data type.

#FLOAT
Float data type in Rust can be classified as f32 and f64. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision. The default type is f64.
DO KEEP IN MIND, TYPE-CASTING NOW ALLOWED IN RUST
