Beginner Rust Learning, I'll update it alongside my rust learning.

### Basic Rust Commands
1. To create a project inside the existing directory, 
```bash
cargo init
```
2. To create a new project with out any existing directory, 
```bash
cargo new NameOfTheProject
```
3. To compile and it without rustc utility,
```bash
carge run
```
4. To compile it without running, 
```bash
cargo build
```
5. To build for production, 
```bash

```
